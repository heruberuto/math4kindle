\tit Sample kindle sheet

This product of my semester project is basically a copied demo of Petr Olsak's \ulink[http://www.olsak.net/opmac-e.html]{OPmac}, which I recommend using with the Kindlify macro.

This open-source sheet should inspire you how to create quality Mathematical notes quickly and simply!

\nonum\notoc\sec Contents

\maketoc  % Table of Contents is auto-generated here

\sec Lists

The lists have to be surrounded by "\begitems"
and "\enditems" sequences.

\begitems
* First item.
* Second item.
  \begitems \style i
    * Nested item list,
    * numbered by roman numerals.
  \enditems
* Last item.
\enditems

\secc Title of Subsection

The subsection text\dots

\sec References

There is a numbered equation. 
The number is auto-generated by "\eqmark" sequence.
$$\label[my-eq]
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2  \eqmark
$$
We can refer to Equation~\ref[my-eq]
on page~\pgref[my-eq].
We can refer to Table~\ref[my-tab] in
Section~\ref[tab-sec] too. And Figure~\ref[my-pic]
is on page~\pgref[my-pic].

\sec Hyperlinks

You can refer to \url{http://petr.olsak.net} using "\url".
Or use "\ulink" if the raw URL needs to be hidden:
\ulink[http://www.olsak.net/opmac-e.html]{OPmac page}.
The parameter text is colorized and it becomes 
an active link if the "\hyperlinks" sequence
is used at the beginning of the document.
Internal links are activated too.

\label[tab-sec]
\sec Tables

The "\table" sequence can be used 
instead of ``low level'' "\halign".
The following table is framed by "\frame" sequence 
in order to get a double frame.

\label[my-tab]
\medskip
\caption/t  Testing table.
\smallskip\nobreak
\centerline{%
   \frame{\table{|r|c|l|}{\crl
           \bf Title A & \bf Title B & \bf Title C \crll
           first & second & third \cr
           next  & text  & last  \crl }}}

\sec Images

The images (PDF, JPG, PNG, TIFF) can be inserted 
by "\inspic" sequence. The "\label" and "\caption/f" 
can be added if you need to refer to a figure.

\centerline {\picwidth=2.7cm \inspic ring.png }
\label[my-pic]
\nobreak
\caption/f The nonempty ideal of a simple ring --
           the ring itself.

\sec Verbatim

In-text verbatim is surrounded by the character declared
by "\activettchar" sequence. The listing can be surrounded
by "\begtt" and "\endtt" sequences
\begtt
This is verbatim.
  All characters are printed $$, \, # etc.
\endtt
or it can be included by "\verbinput" from external file.

\verbinput (95-97) opmac-demo.tex

\sec Math

The Math alphabets
"\mit", "\cal", "\script", "\frak", "\bbchar", "\bi"
are provided. For example:
$$
  {\bi A} = \pmatrix {\cal C  & \script C \cr
                      \frak M & \bbchar R }.  
$$
Hundreds of AMS symbols are available:
$\sphericalangle, \Finv, \boxplus, \Cup, \Cap, \ldots$

\sec Others

The "\typosize" or "\typoscale" sequences set the size
and baselineskip of used fonts (including math fonts).
The "\fnote" generates a footnote\fnote{Like this} and
"\mnote" generates a margin note. 
The "\margins" sets margins and paper dimensions.
The "\cite" sequence can be used for bibliographic citations.
The "\bib" sequence creates one bibliography record. Or 
you can use "\usebib" for direct access to the {\tt.bib} files. 
The list of features does not end here\dots
